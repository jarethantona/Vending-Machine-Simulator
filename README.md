# Vending-Machine-Simulator

## Overview
This project, developed in Java, was built as a Capstone project for Tech Elevator in the month of January 2021. The objective of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles, which includes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 

## Application Information
This is a command line application written in Java. It allows the user to interact with a vending machine, where they can view available items, purchase items, insert money, and historically log user transactions in a .txt file. Tests in JUnit were also written to ensure application functionality.
